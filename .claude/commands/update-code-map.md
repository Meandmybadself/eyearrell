Update the Code Map section in CLAUDE.md to reflect current codebase structure.

Follow these steps:

1. Explore the codebase structure thoroughly:
   - List all directories under `client/`, `service/`, and `shared/`
   - Identify any new files, routes, pages, or components
   - Check for new middleware, services, or utilities

2. Review the current Code Map in CLAUDE.md

3. Update the Code Map section with:
   - New directories or reorganized structure
   - New API routes and their purposes
   - New pages and components
   - New utilities or services
   - Updated key search patterns

4. Keep the format consistent with the existing tables and structure

5. Run `pnpm build` to verify the documentation is accurate

6. Commit the changes with message: "Update CLAUDE.md code map"

Focus on accuracy and completeness. The code map helps Claude navigate the codebase efficiently.
